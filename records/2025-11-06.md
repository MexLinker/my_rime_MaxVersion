# Daily Record — 2025-11-06

This log records changes and actions performed today.

## Summary
- Verified GitHub token read access; write access to issues denied.
- Implemented and then discarded page-wide color scheme switcher per request.
- Kept history panel improvements: theme-aware colors, better layout, hover effects.
- Fixed persistent listener error by replacing event listeners with polling auto-refresh.
- Sorted history snapshots by timestamp (newest first).
- Committed local changes and pushed to `origin/master`.

## Files Touched
- `src/components/MyBar.vue`: polling-based auto-refresh; color improvements; sorted snapshots.
- `src/App.vue`: integrated then reverted theme overrides and switcher overlay.
- `src/control.ts`: added then removed global `colorScheme` state.
- `src/main.css`: added then removed global scheme variables; retained base styles.
- `script_Max/*`: previous edits exist; will be reset to prior revision today.
- `src/simpleDb.ts`: added.

## Notes
- Write-scope test via issue creation failed due to token permissions (`Issues: write`).
- The app runs without listener-related TypeErrors; preview showed no browser errors.

## Next
- If desired, implement a simple two-mode light/dark toggle.
- Update token scopes and re-test write permissions.
